# asteroids-algo
This algorithm is made for a school project, made alone. 

The algorithms are in the `move_ship.c` file in `src`.

There are 3 algo, 1 dumb, 1 "smart", 1 recursive that calculate each possibity until :
1) Each possiblity has been calculated without fouding one that goes to the end, then choose the one that goes the farest
2) A path to the end of the screen has been found

You can compile the project by typing : 
```bash
$> make

$> ./main
```
